# ESRGAN Image Resolution Enhancement Tutorial

## Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of using ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks) and Python to enhance the resolution of your images by up to four times their original size. This tutorial is beginner-friendly and designed to be lightweight, so you can quickly get up and running.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the ESRGAN Repository
Start by cloning the ESRGAN repository to your local machine.



### 2. Install Required Dependencies
Next, you'll need to install the necessary Python packages. You can do this using `pip`:



## Usage

### 1. Prepare Your Image
Make sure you have the image that you want to enhance. Place it in the `input` directory.

### 2. Enhance the Image
To enhance the resolution of your image, run the following command:

```bash
python test.py --input_path path_to_your_image --output_path output_directory
```

This will use ESRGAN to upscale your image and save the result in the specified `output_directory`.

### 3. Check the Output
Once the process is complete, head over to your `output_directory`, and youâ€™ll find the enhanced image there!

## Tips
- The quality of the enhanced image depends on the resolution and quality of the original image.
- ESRGAN works best with images that have sufficient detail.

## Troubleshooting

- **Error: Missing dependencies**  
  If you get an error about missing dependencies, try reinstalling the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- **Low-quality output**  
  If the output quality isn't as good as expected, try using higher-quality source images for better results.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to enhance image resolution using ESRGAN and Python. With just a few commands, you can upsample your images and get high-quality results.
